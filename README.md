# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was a development team asking me to create a program that tracks items in a store, Corner Grocer

# What did you do particularly well?
I felt that I could insert various parts of my Python script effectively in my C++ code. I was able to get the code working on that relatively quickly.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more effecient, secure, and so on?
I could make my code faster by using different syntax when calling my Python file, but I was more comfortable doing it the way that I did it instead.
I need to improve my knowledge of the syntax and when to apply it more to improve my program's security and efficiency.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of the program for me was creating an effective item tracking loop. I went on YouTube for several hours to learn how to do certain 
loops, and that helped me understand how to write a program like this.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Being able to effectively combine programming languages in to one project will help me with the rest of my schoolwork and in my future profession as well. Drawing 
information from another program or project is especially useful once the programs become increasingly difficult.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program easy to read and maintain by implementing good line comments when appropriate. I tried to make it as easy to follow as possible this way. I 
also left empty line spaces so that someone reading it could easily see where things are happening.
